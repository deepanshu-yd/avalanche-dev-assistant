# Getting Started with Avalanche

Avalanche is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). This guide will help you get started with Avalanche development.

## What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is a next-generation blockchain platform that provides:

- **High throughput**: Process thousands of transactions per second
- **Low latency**: Sub-second finality for transactions
- **Eco-friendly**: Energy-efficient consensus mechanism
- **Interoperability**: Connect with other blockchain networks
- **Customizable**: Create application-specific blockchains (subnets)

## Core Components

### Primary Network

The Avalanche Primary Network consists of three built-in blockchains:

1. **X-Chain (Exchange Chain)**: For creating and trading assets
2. **P-Chain (Platform Chain)**: For validating and staking
3. **C-Chain (Contract Chain)**: Ethereum-compatible smart contracts

### Subnets

Subnets are sovereign networks that define their own rules regarding:
- Membership and token economics
- Virtual machine selection
- Validator requirements

## Getting Started

To start developing on Avalanche:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Connect to the Avalanche network
3. Deploy your first smart contract
4. Interact with the blockchain
